# TwitchPlayerPlus
A set of tweaks for the HTML5 Twitch Player coded by me, [EhsanKia](http://twitch.tv/EhsanKia), with contributions from [tduva](http://twitch.tv/tduva) and [Fabrice](https://github.com/fabd).

Feel free to suggest new features and report bugs on GitHub issues page.

### How to install:

1. Install an extension in your browser to manage/update userscripts:
  * Firefox: [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)
  * Google Chrome: [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
2. Once the extension is installed and enabled, open [the userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EhsanKia/TwitchPlayerPlus/master/twitch-player-plus.user.js) to install it.

If something in the player appears broken, disable the script temporarily and reload the page to make sure it's not causing it. This is a good practice with any extension/userscript you install that modifies a website.

### Features:

- Keep volume bar visible
- Put quality options on main bar
- Hide quality options if there are no transcoders
- F hotkey to toggle fullscreen
- Easier access to stream stats
- Display stream latency in the corner
- Scroll to adjust volume in theatre/fullscreen mode (or while holding shift)
- Allow you to set playback speed on VODs
- Hide player alerts for muted sections
